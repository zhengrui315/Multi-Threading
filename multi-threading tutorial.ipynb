    "Python Global Interpreter Lock (**[GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil/)**) allows only one thread to hold the python interpreter. It means only one thread can execute each time. Even if there are multiple CPU or cores, only one CPU will be used.  This limitation means **threading** module in python works well only for IO-bound tasks. This is different in other programming languages such as C, JAVA. For CPU-bound tasks, we can still use **multiprocessing** module in Python. \n",
